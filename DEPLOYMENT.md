# VibeFindr Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

The main issues preventing your JavaScript from working on Vercel/Render were:

1. **Import Path Problems**: The `app.js` file was trying to import from `../../../src/data/default_place_data.js`, which doesn't work in production because the file structure gets flattened.

2. **File Structure**: The `src/` folder was outside the `public/` folder, making it inaccessible to static hosting platforms.

3. **Module Imports**: ES6 module imports weren't properly configured for browser environments.

## Changes Made

1. **Moved Data File**: Created `public/js/default_place_data.js` with the trending places data
2. **Fixed Import Path**: Updated `app.js` to import from `./default_place_data.js`
3. **Added Vercel Config**: Created `vercel.json` for proper static file serving
4. **Added Environment Config**: Created `public/js/config.js` for API endpoint management

## Deployment Steps

### For Vercel:

1. **Push your changes to GitHub**
2. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
3. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build Command: `echo "No build needed"`
   - Output Directory: `public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### For Render:

1. **Push your changes to GitHub**
2. **Create a new Static Site on Render**
3. **Connect your repository**
4. **Configure settings**:
   - Build Command: `echo "No build needed"`
   - Publish Directory: `public`

## Backend API Configuration

If you have a backend API (for the places functionality), you'll need to:

1. **Deploy your backend** to a service like Render, Railway, or Heroku
2. **Update the production API URL** in `public/js/config.js`
3. **Ensure CORS is properly configured** on your backend

## Testing

After deployment, test these features:

- ✅ Trending places should load on the homepage
- ✅ Clicking on place cards should show activity details
- ✅ Navigation between pages should work
- ⚠️ Nearby places functionality requires backend API

## File Structure (Updated)

│       └── default_place_data.js  ← OLD (can be removed)
├── vercel.json                    ← NEW
└── package.json
```

## Troubleshooting

If JavaScript still doesn't work:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify file paths** are correct
3. **Ensure all files are in the `public/` directory**
4. **Check that your hosting platform serves static files correctly**

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your backend API if you have one
2. Update the production API URL in `config.js`
3. Test all functionality in production
4. Consider adding error handling for missing images
